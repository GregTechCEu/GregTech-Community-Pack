The 9 slots on the right are saved up recipes so you can re-use them without re-opening JEI.\n\nThe most important part making the Crafting Station amazing, is the fact that §6it can use adjacent inventories§r in addition to its own inventory.

Creosote can be used as furnace fuel to smelt §d32 items§r, and is required for the creation of §6Treated Wood Planks§r.\n\n\nTo craft this multiblock, you will first need the brick form, which doesn\u0027t get consumed in recipes. You will need 117 clay, and 195 sand.\nCheck the JEI multiblock preview for the structure pattern.\n\n§9Note:§r Any Brick block can be replaced with a §9Coke Oven Hatch§r. That hatch allows for automation. It will auto-export Creosote into connected fluid containers, and it will also accept item insertion/extraction.\n\nIf you have no access to fluid voiding yet, but happen to have too much Creosote at hand, mine the Coke Oven block and replace it.\n\n\n§bLore:§r The concept of Multiblock is very old in modded Minecraft.

At Steam Age, none of the byproducts are obtainable.\n\n§9The steps available in Steam Age go as follows:§r\nOne Ore (block) §9-\u003e§r Two Crushed Ores (Macerator, or Hammer for 1:1 conversion)\nOne Crushed Ore §9-\u003e§r One Impure Dust (Hammer)\nOne Impure Dust §9-\u003e§r One Dust (§oIn world crafting explained below§r)\nOne Dust §9-\u003e§r One Ingot (Furnace, you should know this one)\n\n\nThe rule bends for ores giving more than two dusts (such as redstone), and for dusts that cannot be smelted (redstone again!). Yet you can still do direct smelting to get half the amount you would from the full processing.\n\n§dJEI does not indicate Impure Dust to Clean Dust conversion§r, so keep that in mind that you should §athrow them into filled cauldrons§r (full stacks at once to use less water).\n\nOre Processing will be explained further once you get into LV Age.\n\n\nThere, take this nice reward for your efforts learning this beautiful mess.",

Use your mouse to §drotate§r the preview, §9hover over the parts§r to gain additional informations. The JEI page also contains the amount of blocks to build it. You can also §dright-click§r a block in the preview to get a display of all available blocks in that placement.\n\n\n§lThe JEI preview is a suggestion:§r There is no unique way to form the Multiblock. Most of the time, you have complete freedom for the §9tier of Buses/Hatches§r. And you also have the §dfreedom of placement§r.\n\nTaking the EBF as example, any tier of Energy/Bus/Hatch can be used, and they can be placed anywhere replacing a casing. Fluid Hatches are also optional, though you probably want them to handle recipes with fluid.\n\n\n\nIf a multiblock is formed, but you are having troubles figuring out why it does not run:\n§9-§r Check if the Multiblock is properly plugged in (we all make these mistakes!).\n§9-§r Do the initial Maintenance fix.\n§9-§r Verify the recipe usage, the max EU/t has to be greater than that of the recipe.\n§9- §rCheck the special requirements the recipe may have (JEI always has some kind of indication for it)\n§9-§r Make sure the recipe is properly input, this is less obvious than in a regular machine because you have to juggle between Input Bus and Input Hatch\n§9-§r Make sure there is space for output.
